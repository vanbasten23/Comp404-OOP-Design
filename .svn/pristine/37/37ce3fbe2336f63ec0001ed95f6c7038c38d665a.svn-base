Game description:
Around-the-World-in-80-Days [wb7,xw32]
 
In the background of the novel Around the World in 80 days, starting from England, 
we set up several prefixed routes that finally leads back to England and all players 
should follow the prefixed routes. First, each player will be given certain amount of money. 
From one place to the next destination, the player may choose one kind of transportation 
(plane, train, bus, etc.) for traveling. For each kind of transportation, there are 
corresponding prices and time lengths, which will varies according to several factors 
including season, weather, etc. Some accidents may happen to the player and may 
have either good or bad effects on them. Team works as follows: within the time 
limit (15min), only when all the team members in one team arrive at the destination, 
that team wins. Players have many choices when arriving at a city: move to another 
city or stop moving and work for some extra money. Team mates can interact with each 
other within the team, such as one team member can give money to its team mate who 
falls behind so that he/she can choose faster transportation to catch up sooner.
 
Victory condition: The team with the highest score wins the game. The score will be determined
on the time and money that each team spend.
