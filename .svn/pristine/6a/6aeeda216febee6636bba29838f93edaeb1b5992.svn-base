Game description:
Around-the-World-in-80-Days [wb7,xw32]
 
In the background of the novel Around the World in 80 days, starting from England, 
we set up several prefixed routes that finally leads back to England and all players 
should follow the prefixed routes. First, each player will be given certain amount of money. 
From one place to the next destination, the player may choose one kind of transportation 
(plane, train, bus, etc.) for traveling. For each kind of transportation, there are 
corresponding prices and time lengths, which will varies according to several factors 
including season, weather, etc. Some accidents may happen to the player and may 
have either good or bad effects on them. Team works as follows: within the time 
limit (15min), only when all the team members in one team arrive at the destination, 
that team wins. Players have many choices when arriving at a city: move to another 
city or stop moving and work for some extra money. Team mates can interact with each 
other within the team, such as one team member can give money to its team mate who 
falls behind so that he/she can choose faster transportation to catch up sooner.
 
Victory condition: The team with the highest score wins the game. The score will be determined
on the time and money that each team spend.

On the game GUI, you may see such things:

On the top of the game GUI, you may see "current city" which shows which city you are currently stay at, "Money Spent"
which shows how much money you have left, "Time spent" which shows how many day you have used.

On the left of the game GUI, you may see your personal score and your team score. You may also click the "How to play?"
button to see the game instruction.

On the bottom of the game GUI, you may select the "Next destination" by selecting the city from the first drop list.

You may click "Let's move!" button to move to the next destination. You may click the "Stay&Work" to work at
the current location and earn some money so that you may afford faster transportation.

Here is the rules of the game: The player needs to try their best to use the least time to get back to their original
place. The score will be determined based on how much time he/she uses. The player may choose one of the four
transportations: flight, train, ship, and car. Each transportation corresponds a specific time and price. Flight apparently 
is the fastest transportation but also the most expensive transportation. If a player does not have enough money,
he/she has to work at the current position to get some money before he/she can take a transportation. When all the players
finish the game, the team with the highest score wins the game and a pop-up window will come out showing which team wins.

To close the game, press command+q on Mac OS or Ctrl+q on Windows.
