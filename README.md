Comp404-OOP-Design
==================
This is the final project of the course Comp404(Graduate Object-Oriented Programming and Design). 

In this project, we designed an online game that supports multiple players interaction in Java.
We designed an API for both the server that holds the game and the client that plays the game. 
We also used the Java RMI and the message passing to support the interaction among hosts.
Multiple MVCs(Model-View-Controller design pattern) are used in order to decouple the systems.
We leveraged the extended visitor design pattern and the command design pattern to cope
with various messages so as to increase the flexibility and extensibility.

The detailed documentation can be found in the project folder.
